This flipper serves the purpose of demonstrating the use of several software design patterns. 

The flipper is somewhat playable (console input and console output) by hitting "play" in the Flipper class and using 1,2,3,4, and 5 to interact with it.

As an hommage to 1990s spaceball-flippers - and to make the exercise more entertaining for me and hopefully also for you as a player/grader -, the elements follow a space theme. Also, the flipper's textual messages reflect its somewhat snarky and grumpy personality :).

Please see commit messages for comments about the implementation of different patterns.
